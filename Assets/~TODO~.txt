Known Bugs:
    - Can't reverse the knight movement path. Not crazy bug but would be a nice fix.
    - Knocking off 3 pieces makes the score sound play in weird intervals, this is probably because of the weirdness introduced w/ the switch to Mr. Tween.
    - Reinitializing the tutorial when the new game pulse is happening disables the pulse on return and doesn't allow a new game to be started without going into the settings and manually starting a new game.

Possible Changes & Additions:

    [x] Do some code cleanup
    [ ] Go through "// TODO: "s
